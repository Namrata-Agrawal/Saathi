Your friend is here 24*7 to look after your mental health

## 💡Inspiration
Mental health is often an overlooked and stigmatized issue in many developing countries, in spite of its prevalence. According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) Report, major or minor mental illnesses requiring expert intervention is 7.5 per cent of India’s population. **One in seven Indians** were affected by mental disorders of varying severity. The proportional contribution of mental disorders to the total disease burden in India has almost **doubled since 1990**. Substantial variations exist between states in the burden from different mental disorders and in their trends over time.

In order to contribute to promoting seeking help for mental well-being, we created Saathi!

## 👩🏻‍💻 What is Saathi?
Saathi is a browser extension which provides the user with either help or motivation as per their emotions at that moment. In order to promote asking for help and considering mental wellbeing essential, we came up with Saathi.
