Your friend is here 24*7 to look after your mental health

## 💡Inspiration
Mental health is often an overlooked and stigmatized issue in many developing countries, in spite of its prevalence. According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) Report, major or minor mental illnesses requiring expert intervention is 7.5 per cent of India’s population. **One in seven Indians** were affected by mental disorders of varying severity. The proportional contribution of mental disorders to the total disease burden in India has almost **doubled since 1990**. Substantial variations exist between states in the burden from different mental disorders and in their trends over time.

In order to contribute to promoting seeking help for mental well-being, we created Saathi!
